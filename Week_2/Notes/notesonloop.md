Different Kinds of Loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

            for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
            }


for/in - loops through the properties of an object
    The for loop has the following syntax:

                    for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
                    // code block to be executed
                    }
        Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

        Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

        Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
